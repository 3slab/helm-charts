## Pod anti-affinity can prevent the scheduler from placing RocketChat replicas on the same node.
## The default value "soft" means that the scheduler should *prefer* to not schedule two replica pods onto the same node but no guarantee is provided.
## The value "hard" means that the scheduler is *required* to not schedule two replica pods onto the same node.
## The value "" will disable pod anti-affinity so that no anti-affinity rules will be configured.
##
podAntiAffinity: ""

## If anti-affinity is enabled sets the topologyKey to use for anti-affinity.
## This can be changed to, for example, failure-domain.beta.kubernetes.io/zone
